# Machine Learning formulas implemented in C

This is an exercise in C programming language.
I recommend a professional library for production use.
Make sure to copy the command in `env.sh` and run in the shell before running main.

## Linear Regression

The learning rate -- alpha -- is dynamically calculated in [lr.c](https://github.com/liangcorp/ml_c/blob/c4df85af05f9210243a617cc733b680506c8eadf/src/lr.c#L60-L63). The speed
of linear regression depending on the learning rate and number of iterations.

## Logistical Regression
