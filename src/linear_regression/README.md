# Linear Regression Function

## Cost Function

We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function.
This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of
all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.

$$
J(θ_0, θ_1) = {{1 \over 2m} {\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_θ(x_i) - y_i)^2}}
$$
